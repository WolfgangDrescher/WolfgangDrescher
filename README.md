### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Wolfgang Drescher and I recently became professor of music theory at the [Hochschule fÃ¼r Musik Freiburg](https://mh-freiburg.de/) in Germany. Before that I worked at [jkweb ag](https://jkweb.ch/) and mainly used [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Symfony](https://symfony.com/).

One bigger project I have been involved in is [contrapunto.ch](https://contrapunto.ch/). But you can also check out [Kartimento](https://kartimento.wolfgangdrescher.ch/).
